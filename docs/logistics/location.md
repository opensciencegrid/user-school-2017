Getting From the Best Western to Computer Sciences
--------------------------------------------------

Turn Left at West Dayton Street, continue west on Dayton for about 1 mile 5. The main entrance to the Computer Sciences building is on the right, midway down the 1200 block

### Hotel Shuttle

The Best Western will provide free shuttle service between the hotel and Computer Sciences for those who need it or prefer not to walk.

Madison Metro City Bus Service
------------------------------

The official [Madison Metro Bus page](http://www.cityofmadison.com/metro/schedules/) provides route maps and times for all Madison buses. Google Maps and the Wisconsin phone app also do a good job. Several bus lines run within a couple of blocks of the Best Western and Computer Sciences, and the buses are a great way to get around town when walking or if using the hotel shuttle is not an option.

The Computer Sciences building is a bit confusing — we will post signs to help you find your way. You can always ask people for directions if you get lost.
