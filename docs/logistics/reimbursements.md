Getting Reimbursed for Expenses
===============================

If you paid for certain expenses to attend the OSG User School 2017, then we will reimburse you for them. This page explains what can be reimbursed and how to request reimbursement. Please read this whole page carefully before submitting your request.

**The deadline for all reimbursement submissions is <span style="color: \#F60;">Tuesday, 5 September 2017</span>.**

What Can Be Reimbursed?
-----------------------

We offered to reimburse certain expenses that were part of attending the OSG School:

-   Bus fare to/from Madison
-   Taxi to/from Madison airport
-   Driving mileage (if prearranged)
-   Parking at the hotel (if prearranged)
-   Dinners Monday–Thursday (up to $27 per dinner)
-   Hotel bill (in special, prearranged cases only)

Unfortunately, we are not able to reimburse you for any other expenses (e.g., checked baggage fees, transportation to/from your home and local airport).

What Information Is Needed?
---------------------------

The University of Wisconsin–Madison has strict requirements about reimbursements. See below for each type of expense and its rules.
