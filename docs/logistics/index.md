General Information About the School Schedule
---------------------------------------------

### Travel Schedule

For planning your trip:

-   **Arrive on Sunday, July 16, 2017,** prior to 5 p.m. (if possible). Although classes begin on Monday morning, there is a welcome dinner on Sunday evening for students and instructors. This is a nice way to get to know each other and to start the week.

<!-- -->

-   **Depart on Saturday, July 22, 2017,** any time. The School finishes with another dinner on Friday evening, so it is best to stay that night.

If we offered to pay for your hotel room, we will pay for the six nights of this schedule.

### School Hours

The school is 8:00 a.m. to about 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. A detailed schedule will be available before the School begins.
