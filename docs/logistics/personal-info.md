Documentation Requirements for Non-Resident Aliens
==================================================

In order for the University of Wisconsin to pay for your travel, hotel, or meal expenses, we must have certain personal information from you. We will collect as little information as possible and not share it with anyone except University administrative staff who need it.

When you come to the School in Madison, we will need to look at and verify your travel documents. Please bring all travel documents to the School!

Note: If you are not being reimbursed for any meals and/or travel for the school or if you are from UW-Madison or the Madison area, these documents are not required.

Tasks To Do Now
---------------

Please check your passport and visa for travel in the United States now. Make sure that all documents are valid from now and until after the School ends. If any documents are expired or will expire before the end of the School:

-   Tell us immediately, so that we can help you
-   Begin the process for updating your documents immediately
-   Do whatever you can to expedite the update process

The University of Wisconsin cannot pay for or reimburse you for costs without valid travel documents. We have no control over this policy and there are no exceptions.

-   Tell us immediately, so that we can help you
-   You must provide a letter from your sponsoring organization giving us permission to reimburse you for travel expenses
-   We cannot pay any of your expenses until we receive the letter
-   The letter must come before any travel planning, so get it soon

Documents to Bring to the School
--------------------------------

When you come to Madison, you must bring:

-   Passport
-   U.S. visa
-   U.S. Customs and Border Protection [form I-94](http://www.cbp.gov/travel/international-visitors/i-94-instructions)
    -   If you entered the U.S. before 30 April 2013, the I-94 should be stapled into your passport â€” do not remove it!
    -   If you entered the U.S. after 30 April 2013, the I-94 is stored electronically; [you can request a copy to print from CBP](https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94/request.html)
    -   If you are Canadian, you may use a second form of picture ID instead of the I-94 if you did not obtain an I-94.
-   Additional forms specified in the table below:
