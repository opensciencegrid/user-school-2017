Travel in Madison
=================

We will help coordinate travel within Madison for those who do not have their own transportation.

Travel Between the Madison Airport and the Best Western Hotel
-------------------------------------------------------------

The Best Western hotel can provide free shuttle service from and back to the Madison airport, but there are limited seats available — therefore <span style="font-weight: bold; color: \#F60;">we will organize groups</span> of participants who can take a shuttle together. Shuttle plans will be formed and communicated shortly before the School itself.

The hotel shuttle is free and direct, so it is the best option between airport and hotel. If the shuttle does not work for you, you may take a taxi or ride-sharing service and be reimbursed after the School. But please use this option only if necessary. There are several good taxi companies in Madison, including [http://www.greencabofmadison.com/ Green Cab](http://www.greencabofmadison.com/ Green Cab), [http://www.badgercab.com/ Badger Cab](http://www.badgercab.com/ Badger Cab) and [http://www.unioncab.com/ Union Cab](http://www.unioncab.com/ Union Cab). Cabs are readily available at the Madison airport; elsewhere, you most likely will have to contact the company and request a ride or make a reservation. Note that we can reimburse participants only for taxi or ride-sharing rides between the airport and hotel/campus area.

Travel On and Near Campus
-------------------------

The Best Western hotel is about 1.3 miles away from the Computer Sciences building, where the School is held. There are many good options for getting between the hotel and School, plus other sights, restaurants, and so forth in Madison.

### Walking

It is easy to walk to most places in and around the University of Wisconsin–Madison campus. Use your favorite mapping tool to help, or ask the hotel for a map. In particular, State Street — which connects the Capitol Square with the UW campus — is full of great shops and restaurants and is worth strolling along some time while you are here.

### Hotel Shuttle

The Best Western has a free shuttle that can be used to transport students between the hotel and the School… and other places. Just ask the hotel for more information and availability.

### City of Madison Metro Bus Service

Many [Madison Metro](http://www.cityofmadison.com/metro/) buses stop on the Capitol Square and pass through the University of Wisconsin–Madison campus. Bus fare is $2.00, and transfers may be requested for free. If you plan to use buses to travel to and from the School every day, contact us, and we may be able to buy a bus pass for you or explain how to do so.

The official [Madison Metro Bus page](http://www.cityofmadison.com/metro/schedules/) provides route maps and times for all Madison buses. Google Maps and the Wisconsin phone app also do a good job. Several bus lines run within a couple of blocks of the Best Western and Computer Sciences, and the buses are a great way to get around town when walking or if using the hotel shuttle is not an option.

### Taxis and Ride-Sharing Services

As listed above in the airport-hotel section, there are several good taxi companies in Madison; plus, Uber and Lyft are both active in Madison. **Note:** We cannot reimburse participants for ride services except between the airport and hotel, so this option is on your own.

### Madison BCycle

Madison is a great city to bike in, and there is even a short-term bike rental system called [BCycle](https://madison.bcycle.com) here. For instance, it is possible to get a bike near the hotel, just at the top of State Street, and then drop off the bike at Union South, located immediately adjacent to the Computer Sciences building where the School is held. See the website for more details. While not terribly expensive, this is not a cost that we can reimburse.
