Hotel Information
=================

We have reserved a block of rooms at the [Best Western Premier Park Hotel](http://parkhotelmadison.com/), located on the Capitol Square near campus. They are located at:

> 22 South Carroll Street<br> Madison, WI 53703<br> (608) 285-8000

The hotel has a shuttle that may be available for transporting School participants, and it is located near many bus routes that serve the School location plus all of Madison.

<span style="font-weight: bold; color: \#F60;">We will reserve your room for you within the block, and we will pay for your basic room costs directly.</span> There is one participant per room, so you will not have a roommate.

**NOTE:** Even though we are paying for your hotel room, when you check in, you must provide the hotel with a credit card â€” it is only for optional expenses that you cause by yourself. We will pay for only the room charges and taxes.
