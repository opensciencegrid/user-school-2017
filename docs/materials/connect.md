# OSG Connect Sign-up Instructions

On Tuesday afternoon, you will use OSG Connect to run jobs on OSG.  Before then, please sign up for an OSG Connect
account:

1. Visit the OSG Connect sign up page (<https://osgconnect.net/signup>) and click on the Continue button.  This takes
   you to a page which will let you create a Globus ID or log in if you already have one.

1. After you have signed in or created a Globus ID, you will be asked to link an existing account or continue with the
   current Globus account.  Click on the “No Thanks, continue” button to continue the application process.

1. To complete your sign up, submit an application to join the "osg" project.  It is important that you **choose your
   Globus ID in the username dropdown menu**.  (If not sure, take a close look at Figure 3 in the OSG Connect sign up
   page.)

In the next few minutes, you should get an automated email message that acknowledges the receipt of your application.
