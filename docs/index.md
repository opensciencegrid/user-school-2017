# OSG User School 2017

<p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold;">Could you transform your research with vast amounts of computing?</p>

*Come spend a week at the beautiful University of Wisconsin–Madison and learn how*

During the school, 17–21 July, you will learn to use high-throughput computing (HTC) systems — at your own campus or
using the national Open Science Grid (OSG) — to run large-scale computing applications that are at the heart of today’s
cutting-edge science.  Through lectures, discussions, and **lots of hands-on activities** with experienced OSG staff,
you will learn how HTC systems work, how to run and manage lots of jobs and huge datasets to implement a scientific
computing workflow, and where to turn for more information and help.  Take a look at [the high-level curriculum and
syllabus](curriculum/overview.md) for more details.

The school is ideal for graduate students in any science or research domain where large-scale computing is a vital part
of the research process, plus we will consider applications from advanced undergraduates, post-doctoral students,
faculty, and staff.  Students accepted to this program will receive financial support for basic travel and local costs
associated with the School.

## Applications
